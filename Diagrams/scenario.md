Outline of the scenario

The United Kingdom's healthcare infrastructure relies on the integration between primary and secondary care practices. 

This coursework focuses on designing and implementing a healthcare management system that addresses the core functionalities required in modern healthcare practices. 
The system is intended to address various stakeholder needs.
- Some of these stakeholders include patients seeking medical care,
- general practitioners providing primary healthcare services, specialist doctors offering specialised treatments, nurses delivering clinical support, and administrative staff managing operational aspects of healthcare facilities.

Requirements and scope

The proposed healthcare management system encompasses several critical functionalities essential for effective healthcare delivery. 
- Patients must have the capability to create, modify, and cancel appointments with their general practitioners, providing flexibility and accessibility in healthcare scheduling. 
- The system should accommodate various types of healthcare professionals, including general practitioners who serve as primary care providers, specialist doctors who offer specialised medical expertise, and nurses who provide essential clinical support services.

Administrative and non-clinical staff (e.g., receptionist) working within general practitioner surgeries and hospitals require appropriate system access to manage operational aspects of healthcare delivery. These personnel play crucial roles in patient registration, appointment coordination, record management, and facility operations.

Clinicians ought to be able to create prescriptions based on patient-described symptoms and clinical assessments. We can assume a prescription comprises details about the patient, the condition being treated and a drug that is being prescribed to address the condition. The prescriptions.csv file provides a good indication of what a prescription might entail.

Referral management represents another critical component, facilitating communication between primary and secondary care providers. The system should support referrals from general practitioners to hospital specialists through multiple channels, including email communications and electronic health record updates. When patients arrive at specialist facilities, the relevant referral information must be readily accessible to the receiving healthcare providers. The referrals.csv file provides a good indication of what a referral might entail.
